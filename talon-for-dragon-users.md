# Talon for Dragon Users

*NOTE: this is just an outline, from installation through [scripting](basics-commands/scripting-talon.md), plus some [links](help/links.md); for help say `help help`

## Get [Set Up](install/get-setup.md)

## Write Some Words
Hello there: talon wake, talon sleep

Say Some Words
- dictation mode, command mode
- say/phrase ___, word <a-word>

format some words:
- formatted title my little pony
- formatted string, camel, snake (underscores), smash ( no space)
- select that, format selection title
- cap Apple,   cap That


Say Some  [Letters](basics-write/Alphabet.md), or  `help alphabet`
-  spell that -- e.g., spell that title trap air look odd near (title: capitalize)
-  press shift trap air, press control  sun

navigate some text:
- go right, go right fifth, the word right, go line end/start, escape Backspace
- tab (open | new), tab last, tab next, tab close, tab (reopen|restore), go tab <number>
- go up fifth will go up five lines. Try saying e.g. select up third to hit shift-up three times
-  with dictation: scratch that, with command: scratch that, undo that, undo that nine times
- custom vocabulary: in common file, settings/additional-words.CSV

## Correct Some Words
-  copy all, delete = backspace, clear line, clear word left
- I believe that is "words_to_replace.csv" in knausj. If you're using knausj, just say "customize words to replace" and the csv file will pop up
- Get comfortable with [cursorless](basics-write/cursorless.md)
  - how to turn off the dots with cursorless
