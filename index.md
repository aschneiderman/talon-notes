<h1>How to Switch from Dragon to Talon</h1>


Aka my notes dump on switching from Dragon  + Vocola to Talon, from installation to [practicing the basics](https://chaosparrot.github.io/talon_practice/) editing via  [cursorless](pages/basics-write/cursorless.html) (`cursorless cheat sheet`)to  [scripting](pages/scripting/scripting-talon.html), plus some [links](pages/help/links.html); for help say `help help`

to create:
- next window n
- start talon: 
  - learns command for closing terminal (where to document?)
  - cd C:\Users\ASchneiderman\Documents\GitHub\talon-notes
  - bundle exec jekyll serve
- commands for starting outlook, GitHub; it can't be using  launch

to research:
- visual studio code: terminal commands, link for builtin visual studio code commands
- cursorless: delete several lines
- all of the colors when using cursorless
- open spaceabove line

to memorize:
- go way up slash down
- talon open log
- Rango: hints on/off
- hash: # (what for slash question)




Get Started
- [Get Set Up](pages/install/get-setup.html)
- Hello there: talon wake, talon sleep

Write Some Words

Say Some Words
- dictation mode, command mode
- say/phrase ___, word <a-word>
- dictation mode: scratch that, press for keys

format some words:
-  title my little pony
-  string, camel, snake (underscores), smash ( no space)
- select that, format selection title
- cap Apple,   cap That
- block or <language> block for creating a new md code block


Say Some  [Letters](basics-write/Alphabet.html), or  `help alphabet`
-  spell that -- e.g., spell that title trap air look odd near (title: capitalize)
-  press shift trap air, press control  sun
-  capitalize letters by prefixing them with “ship”. “ship drum” will output D instead of d.
-  If I wanted to write the number 1000, I would say one zero third, to repeat the 0 character 3 times.

navigate some text:
- go right, go right fifth, the word right, go line end/start, escape Backspace, go way up
- tab (open | new), tab last, tab next, tab close, tab (reopen|restore), go tab <number>
- go up fifth will go up five lines. Try saying e.g. select up third to hit shift-up three times
-  with dictation: scratch that, with command: scratch that, undo that, undo that nine times
- custom vocabulary: in common file, settings/additional-words.CSV
- https://tararoys.github.io/Getting-Started-With-Dictation-Mode.html


## Correct Some Words
-  copy all, delete = backspace, clear line, clear word left
- I believe that is "words_to_replace.csv" in knausj. If you're using knausj, just say "customize words to replace" and the csv file will pop up
- Get comfortable with [cursorless](basics-write/cursorless.html)
  - how to turn off the dots with cursorless
- https://github.com/tararo5ys/dense-mouse-grid/blob/dense_mouse_grid_2/dense_mouse_grid/README.md
- phones:  select homophone

## Browse the Web

- (task)
- "copy address" in Rango copies the url. I would check how it's implemented there

## Get Around My Desktop,   My Email Program, Etc.
- launch Internet Explorer
- focus chrome
- running list         (see all active applications),  running hide 
-  super sun: search bar
- https://tararoys.github.io/Navigating-around-the-windows-operating-system.html
- https://tararoys.github.io/Getting-Started-With-Coding-by-Voice.html

- (task)
- (task)
- Find More Commands
  - help active will display the available commands for the active application. navigate help using the displayed numbers. e.g., help one one or help eleven.  help next, help previous, go to the next or previous page of help items if there are a lot, help close (see also help help)
  - command history: the last few commands as Talon understood them
  - Generic editing commands: https://github.com/knausj85/knausj_talon/blob/main/core/edit/edit.talon
