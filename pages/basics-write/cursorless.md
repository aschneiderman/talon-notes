My cursorless notes dump so far:
- Official [documentation](https://www.cursorless.org/docs/)
- `cursor lesscheat cheat` for a list of commands
- cursorless [katas](https://github.com/Will-Sommers/cursorless-katas)

- `please` word: search the command pallet for that word ￼


 - https://jacobegner.blogspot.com/2023/02/talon-voice-and-cursorless-notes.html
 - Re deleting parens, it’s “chuck bounds”, and there’s no doc for it because it’s just a combination of an action with a scope type




- to replace slashes w backslashes: use take blue/whatever slash to take the first one, cursor more tenth to select the next ten and then say backslash


user.vscode("some vs code cmd from cmd pallet")

vscode Talon cmds:

At the beginning, if you are having trouble grabbing the right words, take a closer look at the colors. For example, I was very frustrated until I realized that I kept thinking some dots were green when in fact they were blue. As soon as I realized I was doing that, the problem went away.

To toggle the dots, add a command: confetti off: user.vscode("cursorless.toggleDecorations")

pre every line block
