## Goals and Objectives

Game Goal: how do I make progress & find my mojo in the midst of forces of chaos?
- trying to "level up" while trying not to drown in the day-to-day rush
- getting out from feeling overwhelmed


## High Level Goals

More Joy:
- Color/Art
- Coveting
- Celebrating Small Wins
- Wrestling w Puzzles
- Connection

Less Time in:
- Pain (Hands, Voice)
- Anxiety (e.g., Finances without Dread)

More Time Centered / Relaxed / Restored


## Mechanics

What's fun is:
- playing with ideas
- not pushing too hard
- coveting things / puzzles to figure out

Sketch out a table: what would cards, cubes/icons, etc. represent?


### Quests

Each Quest has one or more Decks: a list of Quest Cards (?) Journey Cards?
- A list of mini-project / task cards
- Partially prioritized (like a backlog)
- Quest Decks are a way of keeping my eye on the prize without getting overwhelmed, and also a way of making easy to know what to do next
- Could Decks be a way to brainstorm/mind map/play with a collection of notes?
- Making working in Visual Studio code Feel like working in Word -- expansive, open, easy on my eyes, playful
- What do I use the way I use page breaks and sections right now? E.g., instead of an outline view, I use "view, multiple pages" to see at a glance the big parts, a feel for the details, and the whole. How might I want to do that in this approach so that it has the right aesthetic feel?
- Also: where do I want free-form? And where do I want to put in tasks/quests, which might be on a website page (how they are stored is a separate question)
- Projects like building up a better suite of writing/idea/note taking/collecting tools: Is figuring this out like building the right magical staff? Or building a power/water plant?
- Recognizing that half the battle is figuring out what you don't know, defining the problem you are trying to solve vs solving it vs defining it a little and taking baby steps iteratively (diagnosing vs medical case management approach)


### Cubes / Icons / Resources (Ink Drops?)
- trying to think more before I speak, the way I'm supposed to given the voice training

spending/losing cubes:
- pushing my hands too hard
- how much voice capacity I have today
- how much anxiety I have, which is driving me towards pushing my hands unnecessarily -- vs. pushing my hands to deal with a crisis
- in the moment: recognizing that I am too anxious, so winning cubes by slowing down, deliberately relaxing

- easily capturing little things, like little irritations that drive use/your users/clients a little nuts
- like collecting pebbles
- Being both able to easily adapt and flex given that you don't really control your circumstances --  don't control what emergencies come up -- but also not turning that into an excuse to let every small thing drag you down (e.g., responding to email/DMs every 30 minutes)
- Part of the game is becoming more comfortable with being a little more systematic at iteratively, experimentally, playfully building out your capacity without getting overwhelmed.
- Being more effective at not spending all of your time being dragged into emergencies and spending more time on building out a better long-term approach/tools in several areas -- e.g., my training scripts, questions to research, creative date of a, mastering EveryAction, voice tools
- Being able to rack up small wins -- even when you aren't sure what direction you should go in or even what's most important (the frustration of being overwhelmed by what I can work on, so spinning my wheels and then it six months later and I haven't made any progress on small problems that have been bugging me)


## Coveting

- Harnessing coveting -- not BS gameification, but recognizing what counts as a "treat" for you or your team and then working towards it, both small and big, which can include things like enjoying color/art


### Coveting / Examples of "Leveling up"
- trying to think more before I speak, the way I'm supposed to given the voice training
- Figuring out what the levels are
- Recognizing that half the battle is figuring out what you don't know, defining the problem you are trying to solve vs solving it vs defining it a little and taking baby steps iteratively (diagnosing vs medical case management approach)


### Daily Game Planning Board
- What I Do
- Resources I Spend (e.g., voice, hands)
- Track & Adapt 

### Actions

Action Cards?


- The Day's Emergencies
- The Day's Questions to Research
- Data Chefs' Creative DataViz
- Teaching
- Mastering EveryAction
- Voice Tools (small tweaks, bigger)


## Game Metaphor

- Magic?
- Cooking?

- Is figuring this out like building the right magical staff? Or building a power/water plant?
- abstract art as a representation of magic/spells
- Magic: Puppy Foo!
- The magic of reaching out to a friend like Max via text
- The magic of acupuncture
- The psychic backlash of bleeding off grief/trauma through my sunlight visualizations
