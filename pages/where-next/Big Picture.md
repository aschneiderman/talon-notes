Metaphor


Nathan:
ideas for game metaphor for trying to improve how you work and your overall level of happiness -- trying to "level up" --  while trying not to drown in the day-to-day rush
getting out from feeling overwhelmed

Civilization building game?
Magician game?
Puppy and kitty pirate Association?


Part of the game is becoming more comfortable with being a little more systematic at iteratively, experimentally, playfully building out your capacity without getting overwhelmed.
Being able to rack up small wins -- even when you aren't sure what direction you should go in or even what's most important (the frustration of being overwhelmed by what I can work on, so spinning my wheels and then it six months later and I haven't made any progress on small problems that have been bugging me)


Being more effective at not spending all of your time being dragged into emergencies and spending more time on building out a better long-term approach/tools in several areas -- e.g., my training scripts, questions to research, creative date of a, mastering EveryAction, voice tools

action cards?

Being both able to easily adapt and flex given that you don't really control your circumstances --  don't control what emergencies come up -- but also not turning that into an excuse to let every small thing drag you down (e.g., responding to email/DMs every 30 minutes)

Projects like building up a better suite of writing/idea/note taking/collecting tools:
Is figuring this out like building the right magical staff? Or building a power/water plant?


Plus easily capturing little things, like little irritations that drive use/your users/clients a little nuts
Light collecting pebbles

Recognizing that you have a quest / area of levels
Figuring out what the levels are
Recognizing that half the battle is figuring out what you don't know, defining the problem you are trying to solve vs solving it vs defining it a little and taking baby steps iteratively (diagnosing vs medical case management approach)


Harnessing coveting -- not BS gameification, but recognizing what counts as a "treat" for you or your team and then working towards it, both small and big, which can include things like enjoying color/art
Maybe I should also ask Aaron? I mean, why not?
Quests

Making working in Visual Studio code Feel like working in Word -- expansive, open, easy on my eyes, playful

Is figuring this out like building the right magical staff? Or building a power/water plant?

- What do I use the way I use page breaks and sections right now?
E.g., instead of an outline view, I use "view, multiple pages" to see at a glance the big parts, a feel for the details, and the whole. How might I want to do that in this approach so that it has the right aesthetic feel?

Also:
where do I want free-form? And where do I want to put in tasks/quests, which might be on a website page
(how they are stored is a separate question)


What I need to think through is one of the kinds of things I need to do?
Think something through
brainstorm/mind map/O little collection of notes

And in this new approach,
do I also want to switch over to
- trying to think more before I speak, the way I'm supposed to given the voice training
- separating writing and editing -15 which might also be a way of dealing with the Christmas tree lights issue
