Dear Mir Chipmunk,

I am reading to you to talk about some exciting new possibilities. Over the past couple of years, I have really enjoyed getting to know you  and getting to know the needs of your clients. I think we have a couple of options for you that you will find very useful.

Here are the options I think you should consider:
Getting really drunk on magic fairy dust
Reducing the number of cursed apples that your fellow chipmunks find in your neighborhoods
Figuring out how to make the leaves can a more peace will cover, but also be more vibrant
Address the situation with unicorns
Get some snazzy outfits
Get some used ti fighters that you can use inside of homes, for example landing on kitchen counters and dining tables



I hope you will find these ideas exciting, and I look forward to discussing with you soon.

Yours come a
Anders
