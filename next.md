# Next Steps



Scripting:
> some_command <user.text>: insert("command {text}\n")

Basic navigation and editing, especially backspace

how to turn off the dots with cursorless

Tidbits:

- I believe that is "words_to_replace.csv" in knausj. If you're using knausj, just say "customize words to replace" and the csv file will pop up
- help help, help alphabet 
- "copy address" in Rango copies the url. I would check how it's implemented there

### Up Next

Get comfortable with cursorless

App names:  I think registry.decls.apps, but please do not use that in business logic in code, the registry is only available for debugging purposes

Mixed dictation mode?
- There's also mixed mode which acts like a dozen dragon/vocola by default.  There's a few settings you need to modify to get it into that mode but I find it works pretty well and use it all the time.  I could never get used to switching between modes...
- In the latest beta you only need to enable both modes at the same time, no other edits necessary (6/1/23)
